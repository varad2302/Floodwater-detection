# Floodwater-detection
My entry for DrivenData.io's Floodwater Mapping Challenge.

-> Floodwater.ipynb can be used to train the model. I have fine-tuned a U-Net architecture with a resnet34 backbone pretrained on ImageNet.
-> PlanetaryComputer.ipynb can be used to download supplementary data from Microsoft's Planetary Computer
